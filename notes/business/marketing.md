# Marketing
Notes from "The 1-Page Marketing Plan" by Allan Dib.


## 0. Introduction
The overall phases of the direct response marketing strategy are:

| Phase  | Status   | Goal                  |
|--------|----------|-----------------------|
| Before | Prospect | Get them to know you  |
| During | Lead     | Get them to like you  |
| After  | Customer | Get them to trust you |

Direct response marketing should be:
- Specific
- Trackable
- Include an offer
- Follow up

A marketing plan encompasses:

| Stage | Example |
| ----- | ------- |
| Advertising | Sign for the circus |
| Promotion | Put the sign on an elephant and walk it into town |
| Publicity | Elephant tramples the mayor's flowers and it makes the news |
| PR | You get the mayor to laugh it off |
| Sales | People come to the circus and spend money |

Strategy changes with scale
- Don't blindly copy large companies. "Branding" to "get your name out there"
  is expensive and ineffective.
- The one and only objective of marketing for a small company is "make a profit"
  For large companies it may be: appease shareholders, board, managers, existing clients, win advertising awards.
  Making a profit is a low priority for them.
- Strategy without tactics = paralysis by analysis
- Tactics without strategy = bright shiny object syndrome

Product quality is a customer **retention** tool, not a customer **acquisition** tool.
- People don't know how good the product is until they've already bought it
- "If you build it, they will come" doesn't work

The 80/20 rule (Pareto principle) states that 80% of the outputs come from 20% of the inputs.
Applying the 80/20 rule to the 80/20 rule gives the 64/4 rule:
64% of the outputs come from 4% of the inputs.
Identify this 4% and focus on it. Often this is marketing.

Spend money to make time, not vice versa. Money is a renewable resource, time is finite.


## 1. Selecting your target market
The niche should be as specific as possible - an inch wide and a mile deep.
- Too borad a target market is useless as the message gets diluted
- Mass marketing/branding can work for larger companies but not small.
  Large companies have enough firepower to fire arrows in all directions.
  Small companies need to fire in a specific direction.

Become a specialist in your field to make price irrelevant
- Become an educator and build trust
- You don't want to be a commodity shopped on price. A customer won on price will be lost on price.

Use the PVP index to identify the ideal niche.
Assign values to each possible segment for:
- Personal fulfillment
- Value to the marketplace
- Profitability

Questions for the target prospect:
- What keeps them up at night?
- What are they afraid of? 
- What are they angry about? Who are they angry at?
- What trends affect them?
- What do they secretly desire most? What one thing do they crave above all else?
- How do they make decisions? Analytical, emotional, social proof
- What language/jargon do they use?
- What magazines do they read? What websites do they visit?
- What is a typical day like?
- What is the single most dominant emotion this market feels?

Create an avatar for each prospect.
Put a name and photo against each market segment and describe a specific person in detail.
Describe their life, job, activities, relationships.
Answer each of the questions above from their POV.


## 2. Crafting your message
There are two key elements of the message:
1. Purpose of the ad
2. What it focuses on

Keep the message focused: 1 ad = 1 objective.
"Marketing on purpose" rather than "marketing by accident".
There should be a clear call to action. You should know the exact action you want the prospect to take next.

The following two questions help refine the USP:
1. Why should they buy?
2. Why should they buy from me?

Key takeaways for USP:
- Why should they buy from you rather than competitor
- If you remove the company name and logo, would people still know it's you?
- Quality and service are **not** USPs. The customer only finds these out after they buy from you.
  USPs should attract customers **before** they buy.
- Lowest price is not a USP. There's always someone willing to go out of business quicker than you.

People rarely want what you're selling, they want the **result** of what you're selling.
Sell the problem.
People don't know what they want until they're presented with it.
Purchasing is done with emotions and justified with logic after the fact.
"If I had asked people what they wanted, they'd have said faster horses" - Henry Ford.

When you confuse them, you lose them.
- Explain the product and its benefit in one sentence.
- The biggest threat isn't that someone buys from a competitor, it's that they do nothing.
- Elevator pitch of the form:
  "You know <problem>? What we do is <solution>? In fact <proof>."

Be remarkable
- Transform something ordinary into something that makes the customer smile.
- Unique is dangerous, you just need to be "different enough".

Craft the offer
- If you don't give a compelling reason to buy, customers will default to price, and you become a commodity.
- Don't just offer a discount, think about which product will definitely solve their biggest problem.
- Add value rather than discounting, through bundles and customisation.
- Create "apples to oranges" comparisons to your competitors to get out of the commmodity game. 
- Target pain points. Sell the problem, not a feature list. Customers in pain are price insensitive.

Create the offer:
- Value to customer
- Language and jargon they use
- Reason why this offer is here. People are skeptical if it is too good to be true.
- Value stacking. Add in high-margin bonuses.
- Upsells
- Outrageous guarantee
- Create scarcity. People react more to fear of loss than prospect of gain.

Writing copy:
- Be yourself and be authentic. "Professional" = boring.
- "The enemy in common". People buy with emotions: fear, love, greed, guilt, pride.
- Copy should address the bad parts of the product, not just the good. Who is this not for?

Naming:
- Title=content
- Choose clarity over cleverness


## 3. Reaching prospects with advertising media
"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half" - John Wanamaker

Measure ROI of ad campaign
- If it made more money that it lost, it was a success. The only metric that matters.
- Customer acquisition cost vs lifetime value of customer
- Other metrics like response rate are only useful to the extent that they help you calculate the above.
- Specific target market is key. The goal of the ad is to make they prospect say "Hey, that's for me".
- What gets measured gets managed. Conversely, what you don't know will hurt you.

Lifetime value of customer = Frontend (initial purchase) + Backend (subsequent purchases)
- Ideally the frontend alone exceeds the customer acquisition cost to be sustainable.
  Then the cost of the ad is immediately recouped and the ad campaign can be reupped for another cycle.

Successful marketing has three components:
1. Market 
2. Message 
3. Media

Social media is a media not a strategy and it's not free. 
It's only _free_ if your time is worthless.

Email is preferable to social media because you own the mailing list.
The customer database which is a valuable asset in its own right.
- Email regularly - weekly at least
- Give value - 3 value-building emails for each offer email
- Snail mail complements email - less cluttered and less competitive because fewer people still use it.

Marketing budget
- The only time for a budget is during the testing phase when your finding what works (what delivers a positive ROI)
- Once you have a campaign that works, go all in. It makes money, it's not an expense so don't limit it.
- If you could buy £10 notes for £5 you'd buy as many as possible, you wouldn't limit it with a budget.
  The same applies for a marketing campaign with a £5 cost of acquisition and £10 lifetime value of customer.

Avoid single points of failure
- One customer, supplier, ad medium, lead generation method.
- Paid media is reliable and allows ROI to be tracked and measured.


## 4. Capturing leads
Treat marketing like farming not hunting. Avoid "random acts of marketing" that hunters do.
Build a CRM system and infrastructure for new leads, follow-ups, conversions, etc.

The first goal is to generate leads - find people who are interested.
- Avoid trying to sell from the ad immediately
- Capture all who could be interested, not just those ready to buy immediately
- Build a customer database, then sell to them later

The market for your product might break down something like:
- 3% - ready to buy now
- 7% - open to buying
- 30% - interested but not right now
- 60% - not interested

By selling directly from the ad you limit yourself just to the 3%. Capture leads first and nurture them to appeal 
to the 40% who are interested.

Educate customers to offer value, then you become a trusted advisor rather than a pest salesman.
