# Pitching
Notes from "Pitch Anything" by Oren Klaff.

Some of the book comes across as a bit incel sigma vibes, talking about alphas and betas.
I don't agree with it, but summarising it here for the parts that are interesting.


## 1. The method
Frames, AKA perspective AKA point of view, describe a person's mental model of controlling the world. 
The person who owns the frame owns the conversation.

Information must penetrate through the following layers of the brain in order. 
1. Survival - "crocodile brain". Ignore anything that isn't new, exciting, dangerous, unexpected. Needs big picture, high contrast points.
2. Social
3. Reason

Logic won't reach the "reason" part of the brain until the croc brain and social brain are satiated.
Data is perceived as a threat by layer 1. the croc brain needs unexpected information that is concrete not abstract.

STRONG process:
- Set the frame
- Tell the story
- Reveal the intrigue
- Offer the prize
- Nail the hook point
- Get the deal


## 2. Frame control 
Frames are the mental structure that shape how you see the world.
When frames collide, the stronger frame absorbs the weaker frame.
If you have to explain your authority, power, position, leverage then you have the weaker frame.

Opposing frames and how to counter them.
1. Power frame - fuelled by status and ego
   - Don't react to our strengthen their status
   - Acts of denial/defiance - establish your own rituals of power rather than abiding by theirs.
   - Mildly shocking but not unfriendly. Humour is key.
2. Prize frame
   - Make yourself the prize. Make them qualify themselves to you. The money has to earn you, not the other way around.
   - Make statements not "trial close" questions
3. Time frame - occurs later in the interaction
   - Stop as soon as you are done OR have lost their attention. Continuing further signals desperation.
4. Analyst frame - stats, technical details
   - Intrigue frame counters this
   - The brain can't perform cold cognitions (analysis) at the same time as hot cognitions (excitement)
   - Tell a brief, relevant, intriguing story with tension involving you at the centre of it to break the cold cognition.


## 3. Status
Global status is a function of wealth, power and status.

Beta traps enforce your lower status.
E.g. making you wait, big dogs not showing up to meetings, small talk before meetings.

Situational status is the temporary shift of status based on the situation.
Create local star power to increase your situational status.
- Ignore power rituals, avoid beta traps, ignore their global status
- Frame control - small, friendly acts of defiance
- Local star power - shift conversation to a topic where you are the domain expert
- Prize frame - position yourself as the reward, e.g. leave after a hard cut off time
- Confirm your status - make them say you're the alpha

Shock -> frame control -> local star power -> hook point -> leave
