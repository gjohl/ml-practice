# Public Speaking
Notes from reading "Ted Talks: The offical TED guide to public speaking" by Chris Anderson.


## Foundation
### 1. Presentation literacy
Presentation literacy is its own skill.
Your goal is to be you, not a version of someone you like.


### 2. Idea building
Ideas are all that matter in the talk.
This can be a novel idea, or a novel story or presentation of an existing idea.

Your goal is to recreate the core idea inside your audience's mind.
The language you use must be shared by the speaker and listener for it to have this effect.
Focus on what you can **give** to the audience.

Visualise the talk as a journey that you guide the user through. 
Start where the audience starts.
Don't make any impossible leaps or unexpected changes of direction.

- What issues matter the most
- How are they related?
- How can they be easily explained?
- What are the key open questions? Controversies?


## 3. Common traps
Four talk styles to AVOID.

1. Sales Pitch
    - You should give not take.
    - Generosity evokes a response.
2. Ramble
    - Insults the audience; suggests that their time doesn't matter to you.
3. Organisation bore
    - Your company's structure is boring.
    - Focus on the work and ideas, not the company, products or individuals.
4. Inspiration tryhard
    - All style and no substance.
    - Comes across as manipulative.
    - Inspiration has to be earned. "Like love you don't get it by pursuing it".
    - Inspiration is the response to authenticity, courage, wisdom, selflessness.


## 4. The throughline
The throughline is a connecting theme that ties the narrative elements
- A focused, precise, unexpected idea
- Not the same as a theme
- You should be able to encapsulate it in <15 words

Trace the path the journey will take.
If the audience knows where you're going, it will be easier to follow.

Cut down the talk to keep the throughline focused.
- DON'T just keep all the content but say it in less detail. Overstuffed = underexplained
- Cut back the **range** of topics. Say less with more impact.
- "The power of the deleted word".
- An 18 minute time limit is short enough to keep an audience's attention, long enough to cover enough ground and precise enough to be taken seriously.

The overall structure can be thought of in 3 parts: What? So what? What now?
In more detail, this is:
1. Intro - what will be covered
2. Context - why this issue matters
3. Main concepts
4. Practical implications

Talk about ideas not issues.
Write for an audience of one.

Checklist:
- Is this a topic I'm passionate about? Do I know enough to be worth the audience's time? Do I have credibility?
- Does it inspire curiosity?
- Will knowing this make a difference to the audience?
- Is the talk a gift or an ask?
- Is the information fresh?
- Can the topic be covered in enough detail with examples in the time slot?
- What are the 15 words that encapsulate the talk?
- Would those 15 words persuade someone they're interested in hearing the talk?


## Talk tools
### 5. Connection
A human connection is required before you can inform, persuade or inspire.
Knowledge has to be **pulled in**, not pushed in.
Be AUTHENTIC.

Dos
- Eye contact.
- Vulnerability, but authentic.
- Humour signals to the group that you've all connected.
 
Don'ts
- Ego breeds contempt.
- Avoid tribal topics/language, e.g. politics.


### 6. Narration
Storytelling helps people to imagine and dream -> empathise -> care

Key elements:
1. Character
2. Tension
3. Right level of detail
4. Satisfying resolution

If you're telling a story, know why you're telling it.
The goal is to give, not boost your ego.

Connect the dots enough, but don't force-feed the conclusion.


### 7. Explanation
Steps:
1. Start where the audience is. No assumed knowledge or jargon.
2. Spark curiosity. Create a knowledge gap that the listener wants to fill.
3. Introduce new concepts one-by-one. **Name** each concept.
4. Metaphors and analogies. Reveal the "shape" of new concepts.
5. Examples confirm understanding.

Knowledge is built hierarchically. 
Explain the structure and where each concept fits.
Convert a web of ideas into a string of words.

Curse of knowledge. Revisit assumed knowledge.

Make clear what the concept **isn't**.
An explanation is a small mental model in a large space of possibilities. Reduce the size of that space.
